## User Story
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications  
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples  
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position  

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer  
WHEN I load the portfolio  
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer  
WHEN I view the header  
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio  
WHEN I view the navigation titles  
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted  
WHEN I click on a navigation title  
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted  
WHEN I load the portfolio the first time  
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default  
WHEN I am presented with the About Me section  
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them  
WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section  
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository  
WHEN I am presented with the Contact section  
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message  
WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text  
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required  
WHEN I enter text into the email address field  
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address  
WHEN I am presented with the Resume section  
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies  
WHEN I view the footer  
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
